= ShellIntegration.jl Roadmap

== v0.1.0 - The Bridge (Current)
* [x] `run_pwsh` wrapper.
* [x] Basic `Valence` shell stub.
* [x] `exec_safe` command sanitizer.

== v0.2.0 - Advanced Shell
* [ ] **PowerShell Objects**: Convert JSON output from `pwsh` directly into Julia Structs/DataFrames.
* [ ] **Valence Capabilities**: Implement the full capability logic (Network, FS, Env).
* [ ] **REPL Mode**: A custom Julia REPL mode (press `>`) to enter ShellIntegration directly.

== Future Horizons (v1.0+)
* [ ] **Distributed Shell**: Execute commands across a cluster of verified machines.
* [ ] **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs of every shell command executed via the library.
