*Joyful, Playful, and Visual Coding for Kids*

_Building strong computational thinking foundations through real Julia._

toc::[]

== Overview

JuliaForChildren.jl is designed to make the first steps into programming a joyful and confidence-building experience. By focusing on visual feedback, simple games, and "playable" coding activities, it teaches real Julia fundamentals (variables, loops, functions) without the overwhelming syntax load typically found in adult-focused libraries.

== Core Capabilities

* **Guided Lessons**: Small checkpoints with instant, friendly feedback.
* **Coding Sandbox**: A safe environment for drawing, simulations, and basic game dev.
* **Concept Ladder**: A structured curriculum moving from basic variables to data science basics.
* **Achievement Tracking**: Earn skill badges and track streaks to maintain momentum.
* **Instructor Mode**: Specialized dashboards for parents and teachers to monitor classroom progress.

== Quick Start

[source,julia]
----
using JuliaForChildren

# Load a fun lesson on loops
lesson = load_lesson("shapes-and-loops")

# Kids write simple code to draw
# Exercise: "Draw 5 blue circles!"
run_exercise(lesson, code="""
for i in 1:5
    draw_circle(color=:blue, x=i*10)
end
""")

# Check progress and badges
report = build_progress_report(learner)
----

== Suggested Tech Stack

* **Notebooks**: `Pluto.jl` for reactive, interactive learning.
* **Visuals**: `CairoMakie.jl` or `Luxor.jl` for drawing and art.
* **Data**: `DataFrames.jl` for simple record-keeping.

== Pedagogy & Safety

* **Feedback First**: Strong positive reinforcement before any corrective guidance.
* **Air-Gapped by Design**: No external network dependencies required for core lessons.
* **Real Skills**: No "toy" languages—kids learn actual Julia syntax used in research.
