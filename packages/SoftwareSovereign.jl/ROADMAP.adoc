= SoftwareSovereign.jl Roadmap

== v0.1.0 - The Policy Core (Current)
* [x] Renamed from LicensePicker to reflect wider scope.
* [x] `SoftwarePolicy` data structure.
* [x] Multi-manager backend abstraction (`DNF`, `Flatpak`, `ASDF`).

== v0.2.0 - Universal Drivers
* [ ] **Flatpak Driver**: Full AppStream XML parsing and permission auditing.
* [ ] **DNF/Apt Driver**: Parsing local repo databases for license and origin info.
* [ ] **ASDF Driver**: Auditing tool-versions against vulnerability databases.
* [ ] **Telemetry Scanner**: A database of known 'phone-home' domains mapped to binary strings in packages.

== v0.3.0 - Desktop Enforcement
* [ ] **GNOME Sentinel**: A background service that notifies you when a newly installed app violates your Sovereignty Policy.
* [ ] **Sovereign Dashboard**: A GTK or web-based UI to toggle policies and view violations.

== Future Horizons (v1.0+)
* [ ] **Axiomatic Policy Proofs**: Link with `Axiom.jl` to formally prove that a specific policy *cannot* be bypassed by a specific package manager configuration.
* [ ] **Blockchain Provenance**: Verify package signatures against an immutable ledger of trusted build artifacts.
