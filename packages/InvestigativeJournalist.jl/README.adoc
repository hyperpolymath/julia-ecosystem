*Structured Evidence for High-Stakes Reporting*

_Turn messy source material into audit-ready investigative artifacts._

toc::[]

== Overview

InvestigativeJournalist.jl is a Julia toolkit for managing the end-to-end investigative reporting workflow. It provides high-integrity structures for ingesting diverse sources, extracting verifiable claims, and building a corroboration matrix that minimizes editorial and legal risk.

== Core Capabilities

* **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Ingest documents, web snapshots, and interview notes with automatic hashing and deduplication.
* **Claim Extraction**: Extract discrete claims and link them to entities (people, orgs, places).
* **Corroboration Matrix**: Quantify confidence levels across claims and multiple supporting sources.
* **Auditable Provenance**: Every claim in your final draft traces back to a cryptographically hashed source document.
* **Timeline & Network Analysis**: Visualize actors and events to detect gaps or contradictions in narratives.

== Quick Start

[source,julia]
----
using InvestigativeJournalist

# Ingest a source document
doc = ingest_source("docs/leaked_contract.pdf")

# Extract claims and link to entities
claims = extract_claims(doc)
link_entities!(claims)

# Build a corroboration matrix
matrix = corroborate(claims, all_docs())

# Generate a publication-ready evidence pack
pack = generate_publication_pack(story_draft)
----

== Suggested Tech Stack

* **Data**: `DataFrames.jl`, `Arrow.jl`, `JSON3.jl`
* **Persistence**: `SQLite.jl` or `DuckDB.jl`
* **Text Analysis**: `TextAnalysis.jl`
* **Visualization**: `Makie.jl`

== Safety & Governance

* **Source Protection**: Support for encrypted fields and redacted exports for sensitive whistleblowers.
* **Audit Trail**: Immutable logs for every change in confidence scores or claim text.
* **Zero-Unreferenced Policy**: Final publication packages prevent inclusion of any claim without a verified evidence link.
