== What is Causals.jl?

Causals.jl brings together the major approaches to causal reasoning under one roof:

* **Dempster-Shafer theory** - combine uncertain evidence from multiple experts
* **Bradford Hill criteria** - assess causality in observational studies
* **Causal DAGs** - graphical models, d-separation, identification
* **Granger causality** - time series causal analysis
* **Propensity scores** - matching, weighting, stratification for observational data
* **Do-calculus** - Pearl's intervention framework
* **Counterfactuals** - "what if" reasoning about alternate realities

== Why Causals.jl?

**Existing Julia packages are fragmented:**
- `CausalInference.jl` - only DAGs
- `Causal.jl` - simulation only
- `CausalityTools.jl` - basic stats only

**Causals.jl eclipses them with:**
- Complete coverage of causal inference methods
- Production-grade implementations
- Comprehensive documentation
- Active development
- RSR compliance (Rust/Deno standards adapted for Julia)

== Quick Examples

=== Dempster-Shafer Evidence Combination

[source,julia]
----
using Causals

# Expert 1: 60% confident in hypothesis A
frame = [:A, :B, :C]
expert1 = MassAssignment(frame, Dict(
    Set([:A]) => 0.6,
    Set([:A, :B, :C]) => 0.4  # ignorance
))

# Expert 2: 70% confident in A or B
expert2 = MassAssignment(frame, Dict(
    Set([:A, :B]) => 0.7,
    Set([:A, :B, :C]) => 0.3
))

# Combine evidence
combined = combine_dempster(expert1, expert2)
@show belief(combined, Set([:A]))       # Lower bound
@show plausibility(combined, Set([:A])) # Upper bound
----

=== Bradford Hill Causal Assessment

[source,julia]
----
criteria = BradfordHillCriteria(
    strength = 0.85,           # Strong correlation
    consistency = 0.90,        # Replicated across studies
    specificity = 0.60,        # Moderate specificity
    temporality = 1.0,         # Cause precedes effect (REQUIRED)
    biological_gradient = 0.75,# Clear dose-response
    plausibility = 0.80,       # Biologically plausible
    coherence = 0.70,          # Fits known facts
    experiment = 0.0,          # No RCT (observational)
    analogy = 0.65             # Similar known relationships
)

verdict, confidence = assess_causality(criteria)
# verdict: :strong, confidence: 0.78
----

=== Granger Causality (Time Series)

[source,julia]
----
# Does oil price Granger-cause inflation?
oil_price = [....]  # historical data
inflation = [....]

causes, F_stat, p_value, lag = granger_test(oil_price, inflation, max_lag=12)

if causes
    println("Oil price Granger-causes inflation with lag $lag months")
    println("F-statistic: $F_stat, p-value: $p_value")
end
----

=== Causal DAG and Backdoor Criterion

[source,julia]
----
# Build causal graph: Education → Income, Ability → Education, Ability → Income
g = CausalGraph([:Education, :Income, :Ability, :ParentIncome])
add_edge!(g, :Education, :Income)
add_edge!(g, :Ability, :Education)
add_edge!(g, :Ability, :Income)
add_edge!(g, :ParentIncome, :Education)

# To estimate effect of Education on Income, must control for Ability
@assert backdoor_criterion(g, :Education, :Income, Set([:Ability]))

# Ability blocks backdoor path: Education ← Ability → Income
----

=== Propensity Score Matching

[source,julia]
----
# Observational study: does training program increase wages?
treatment = [....]  # received training (Bool)
wages = [....]      # outcome
covariates = [....]  # age, education, experience (Matrix)

# Estimate propensity scores
ps = propensity_score(treatment, covariates)

# Match treated to similar controls
matches, ate, std_err = matching(treatment, wages, ps, caliper=0.1)

println("Average treatment effect: $(ate) ± $(1.96*std_err)")
----

=== Counterfactual Reasoning

[source,julia]
----
# Among those who got treatment and recovered, would they have recovered without it?
treatment = [:Treatment => true]
outcome = :Recovered
data = Dict(
    :Treatment => [...],  # Bool vector
    :Recovered => [...] # Bool vector
)

pn = probability_of_necessity(:Treatment, :Recovered, data)
println("Probability treatment was necessary: $(pn)")
----

== Quick Start

[source,julia]
----
using Causals

# Combine evidence from multiple experts using Dempster-Shafer
frame = [:A, :B, :C]
expert1 = MassAssignment(frame, Dict(Set([:A]) => 0.6, Set([:A, :B, :C]) => 0.4))
expert2 = MassAssignment(frame, Dict(Set([:A, :B]) => 0.7, Set([:A, :B, :C]) => 0.3))

combined = combine_dempster(expert1, expert2)
println(belief(combined, Set([:A])))  # Lower bound on probability of A
