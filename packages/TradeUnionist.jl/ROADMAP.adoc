= TradeUnionist.jl Roadmap

== v0.1.0 - Organizing Core (Current)
* [x] Core data models (`Worksite`, `MemberRecord`, `GrievanceCase`).
* [x] Membership registry and basic sentiment tracking.
* [x] Workplace map schema (Departments/Shifts).
* [x] CSV export for member lists.

== v0.2.0 - Grievance & Enforcement
* [ ] Grievance lifecycle workflow (Intake -> Step 1 -> Arbitration).
* [ ] Evidence locker (linking documents to cases).
* [ ] Automated deadline alerts for contract violations.
* [ ] Reporting dashboard for "Grievance Density" by department.

=== Advanced Mapping & Analytics
* [ ] **Mapping Mashups**: Integration with external GeoJSON data (Census/District maps).
* [ ] **Strike Propensity Model**: Predictive modeling based on sentiment and bargaining impasse.
* [ ] **Gender/Racial Wage Gap**: Specialized audit tools for pay equity.

=== Future Horizons (v2.0+)

==== Data Sovereignty & Privacy
* [ ] **Member-Owned Data Vaults**: Frameworks for workers to host and control their own organizing data, providing the union with revocable access.
* [ ] **Redaction-by-Default**: Automated PII (Personally Identifiable Information) masking for shared research datasets to protect workers from surveillance.

==== Algorithmic Accountability
* [ ] **Algorithmic Bias Monitor**: Tools to detect and prove bias in employer-used scheduling or performance algorithms (linking to `Axiology.jl`).
* [ ] **Counter-Surveillance Tools**: Log and analyze employer anti-union messaging patterns to prepare legal rebuttals.

==== Automated Mobilization & Solidarity
* [ ] **Mobilization Forecasting**: Use Monte Carlo simulations to predict turnout for rallies based on previous engagement and geographic distribution.
* [ ] **Global Solidarity Bridge**: Secure protocol for cross-border bargaining coordination between international locals of the same multinational employer.
* [ ] Mobilization planner (Turnout targets, volunteer assignments).
* [ ] Strike fund simulator and management.
* [ ] Immutable audit log for all sensitive data access.

== Future Horizons (v2.0+)

=== Labor Intelligence
* [ ] **Causal Organizing Models**: Use `Causals.jl` to identify the most effective organizing interventions for specific workforce demographics.
* [ ] **Automated Power Mapping**: Use network analysis to identify "Natural Leaders" based on communication patterns and sentiment (linking to `PostDisciplinary.jl`).

=== Verified Bargaining
* [ ] **Axiomatic Contract Proofs**: Use `Axiom.jl` to formally prove that a proposed contract change doesn't violate specific "Floor" standards or equitable distribution rules.
* [ ] **Economic Impact Verification**: Link with `Cliometrics.jl` to provide historical context and verified economic impact reports for labor negotiations.

=== Decentralized Solidarity
* [ ] **Secure Member Voting**: Implement zero-knowledge, verifiable voting protocols for contract ratifications and strike votes.
* [ ] **Solidarity Gossip Protocol**: Enable secure, encrypted communication between different union locals using `Skein.jl` federated search concepts.
