== Long-Term Vision

=== Formal Foundations
* Collaborate with **Lean4 mathlib** to formalize measure-theoretic results
* Integrate with **Coq** probability libraries for verified computations
* Develop **Idris2** proofs of algorithm correctness

=== Ecosystem Integration
* **Turing.jl**: Bayesian inference with zero-probability priors
* **DifferentialEquations.jl**: Rare events in stochastic ODEs/PDEs
* **Flux.jl**: Density-aware neural network training
* **ECHIDNA**: Probabilistic theorem proving with relevance measures

=== Research Directions
* **Computational Topology**: Persistent homology with Hausdorff measures
* **Information Geometry**: Fisher information on measure-zero sets
* **Ergodic Theory**: Generic properties and measure-theoretic dynamics
* **Set-Theoretic Topology**: Descriptive set theory applications

== Future Horizons (v3.0+)

=== Quantum & Singular Logic
* [ ] **Quantum Null-Space Logic**: Formalize the reasoning about measure-zero outcomes in quantum Hilbert spaces, specifically for error correction and decoherence analysis.
* [ ] **Singularity-Aware Dynamics**: Integration with `DifferentialEquations.jl` to provide "Measure-Theoretic Regularization" for physical models approaching singular points (e.g., fluid turbulence, gravitational singularities).

=== Axiomatic Risk & Tail-Safety
* [ ] **Black Swan Invariants**: Link with `Axiom.jl` to formally prove that a risk model satisfies specific "Fat-Tail" properties, guaranteeing it cannot underestimate extreme event probabilities below a certain threshold.
* [ ] **Verified Catastrophe Bounds**: Provide mathematically guaranteed bounds on the maximum impact of zero-probability events in high-stakes systems (finance, nuclear, aerospace).

=== Meta-Probabilistic Foundations
* [ ] **Theory Uncertainty Framework**: Support for switching between alternative axiomatic foundations (e.g., Non-Standard Analysis, Constructive Measure Theory) when standard Kolmogorov axioms lead to undecidable zero-prob scenarios.
* [ ] **Infinite-Dimensional Measure Discovery**: Automate the discovery of relevant measures for infinite-dimensional function spaces used in functional analysis and path integrals.

=== AI Safety & Robustness
* [ ] **Impossible Input Detection**: Use Hausdorff measures to formally detect inputs that are "Topologically Impossible" for a trained model, preventing out-of-distribution hallucinations.
* [ ] **Rare Event Loss Functions**: Develop neural network loss functions that prioritize accuracy on measure-zero or extremely low-probability "Safety Boundaries".
