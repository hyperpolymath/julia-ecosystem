== Vision
To provide a seamless computational environment where high-level research across any discipline can be formally verified, causally modeled, and visually synthesized.

== Phase 1: Consolidation & Hardening (Current)
* [x] **Monorepo Transition**: Consolidate 20+ standalone repos into a unified structure.
* [x] **Standard Documentation**: Align all packages with `README.adoc` and `ROADMAP.adoc` standards.
* [ ] **Unified CI**: Implement a "Smart CI" that triggers tests based on changed subdirectories.
* [ ] **Registry Submission**: Register all core modules in the Julia General Registry using `subdir` support.

== Phase 2: Integration & Synergy (v1.0)
* [ ] **Post-Disciplinary Glue**: Complete the `PostDisciplinary.jl` orchestration layer to link all modules.
* [ ] **Cross-Modality Storage**: Native integration of all packages with `VeriSimDB` for federated research.
* [ ] **Common Ontology**: Define a shared entity schema (People, Proofs, Claims, Events) used across the entire ecosystem.
* [ ] **Verification Standard**: Ensure every library has at least one `Axiom.jl`-verified property.

== Phase 3: Planetary-Scale Research (v2.0+)
* [ ] **Federated Search**: Enable cross-institutional searching of research artifacts via `Skein.jl`.
* [ ] **Axiomatic World Models**: Build integrated models of global risk that combine physics, history, and social theory.
* [ ] **Autonomous Researcher**: AI agents that use the entire ecosystem to discover and prove cross-disciplinary relationships.

== Major Sub-Ecosystem Goals

=== 🧪 Formal Science Track
* Move from property checking to full formal proof in `Axiom.jl`.
* Implementation of verified Quantum and Homomorphic computing in `ProvenCrypto.jl`.

=== 🏛️ Social & Historical Track
* Full `Seshat` databank integration in `Cliodynamics.jl`.
* Causal attribution of historical policy interventions in `Causals.jl`.

=== ✊ Power & Organizing Track
* Full spatial "Power Maps" for global labor organizations in `TradeUnionist.jl`.
* Verified, tamper-proof whistleblower "Drops" in `InvestigativeJournalist.jl`.

_Synthesis is not the end, but the beginning of a higher order of knowledge._
