= Skein.jl Roadmap
:toc:

== v0.1.0 (Complete)

* [x] Core types: `GaussCode`, `KnotRecord`
* [x] SQLite storage backend with WAL mode
* [x] Invariant computation: crossing number, writhe, Gauss hash

* [x] Import/export: CSV, JSON, bulk import
* [x] Deduplication via content-addressed hashing
* [x] 51 tests passing

== v0.2.0 (Complete)

* [x] Jones polynomial column with schema migration (v1 -> v2)
* [x] KnotInfo import (prime knots 0_1 through 7_1)
* [x] Composable query predicates with `&` (AND) and `|` (OR)
* [x] Knot equivalence checking (canonical form, cyclic rotation, relabelling)
* [x] Mirror image and amphichirality detection
* [x] Reidemeister I simplification
* [x] `find_equivalents` and `find_isotopic` database searches

* [ ] Reidemeister III simplification (triangle moves)
* [ ] Full topological amphichirality detection
* [ ] Extended KnotInfo table (prime knots through 10+ crossings)
* [ ] Alexander polynomial (standalone computation)
* [ ] Bracket polynomial (standalone computation)
* [ ] KnotTheoryExt integration tests
* [ ] CSV import test coverage
* [ ] CI/CD workflows (CodeQL, Scorecard, mirror, hypatia-scan)

== v0.4.0 (Future)

* [ ] Link support (multi-component knots)
* [ ] Knot atlas web integration (fetch from KnotInfo online)
* [ ] Spatial graph database extension
* [ ] PackageCompiler.jl shared library for C FFI
* [ ] Idris2 ABI formal interface proofs
* [ ] Zig FFI C-compatible bindings
* [ ] Performance: connection pooling, prepared statement caching
* [ ] Knot diagram visualisation (via Makie.jl extension)

== Long-term

* [ ] Distributed knot database (multi-node SQLite replication)
* [ ] Knot machine learning features (embedding vectors for knot classification)
* [ ] Integration with computational algebra systems (GAP, Sage)
* [ ] WASM compilation for browser-based knot explorer

== Future Horizons (v1.0+)

=== Decentralized & Federated Topology
* [ ] **Federated Skein Protocol**: Enable peer-to-peer searching of knot databases across different research institutions using a shared gossip protocol.
* [ ] **Content-Addressed Knot Storage**: Full integration with IPFS for permanent, verifiable storage of knot diagrams and their invariants.

=== Topological Machine Learning
* [ ] **GNN Embedding Index**: Native database support for storing and querying knots by their Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedding vectors, enabling "Fuzzy Topology" searches.
* [ ] **Automated Invariant Discovery**: Use the database as a training set for finding new, computationally efficient topological invariants.

=== Axiomatic Data Integrity
* [ ] **Proof-Carrying Records**: Store an Axiom.jl-verified "Proof Certificate" alongside every invariant value to guarantee its mathematical correctness.
* [ ] **Verified Migration Engine**: Formally prove that schema migrations preserve the topological integrity of Gauss codes.

=== Blockchain & Web3 Integration
* [ ] **Topological Identity Oracles**: Export knot records and their proofs to smart-contract compatible formats for use in blockchain-based identity systems.
* [ ] **Skein-on-Chain**: A lightweight verification layer for checking knot invariants directly on EVM or Move-based blockchains.
