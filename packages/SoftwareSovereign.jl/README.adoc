*Universal Policy Engine for Total System Control.*

SoftwareSovereign.jl is a meta-package manager that sits on top of `dnf`, `apt`, `flatpak`, and `asdf`. It allows you to define and enforce high-level software policies across your entire computing environment.

== The Vision: Policy-Based Management

Stop thinking about individual packages. Start thinking about **Policies**:
*   "No proprietary binaries from companies with known privacy violations."
*   "Only software with OSI-approved licenses."
*   "Block any package that requests broad filesystem permissions by default."

== Usage

using SoftwareSovereign

# Define your personal sovereignty policy

    disallowed_orgs = ["google", "microsoft", "meta"],
    excluded_archs = ["i386", "i686", "noarch"], # Cleanup DNF listings
    require_open_source = true,
    block_telemetry = true

# Audit your entire machine
