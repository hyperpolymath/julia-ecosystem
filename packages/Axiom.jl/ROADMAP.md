# Axiom.jl Roadmap

## Current Baseline (v1.0.0)

Axiom.jl provides:
- Core tensor/layer pipeline in Julia
- Verification checks (`@ensure`, property checks, certificates)
- High-performance Zig backend with SIMD vectorization and multi-threaded dispatch
- GPU extension hooks for CUDA/ROCm/Metal

Current focus is stabilization: production-grade build/test/runtime reliability, accurate docs, and explicit feature status.

## Near-Term Plan

### Must
- [x] Complete backend parity and reliability for CPU + Zig + GPU extension paths.
- [x] Harden verification/certificate workflows for repeatable CI and artifact integrity.
- [x] Keep README/wiki claims aligned with tested behavior.

Must execution order (sorted):
1. Backend parity/reliability (CPU + Rust + GPU extensions) - Completed (2026-02-16).
2. Verification/certificate workflow hardening - Completed (2026-02-16).
3. README/wiki claim alignment sweep - Completed (2026-02-16).

Must completion gates:
- [x] Core-op parity tests pass on CPU Julia and Zig backend (matmul, dense, conv, normalization, activations) with documented tolerance budgets.
- [x] GPU extension paths (CUDA/ROCm/Metal) have deterministic CI jobs where hardware is available, and explicit fallback-behavior tests where it is not.
- [x] `instantiate/build/precompile/test` succeeds in CI on supported Julia versions without manual steps.
- [x] Runtime smoke tests for documented examples pass on CPU and at least one accelerated backend.
- [x] No unresolved legacy triad markers (`TO[D]O`/`FIXM[E]`/`TB[D]`) in `src`, `ext`, and `test` for release-scoped areas.
- [x] README/wiki claims are audited against implemented APIs and CI-tested behavior, with roadmap links for deferred features.

Must progress snapshot (2026-02-16):
- [x] CI workflow now runs explicit `instantiate/build/precompile/test` steps across supported Julia versions.
- [x] Added backend parity script with documented tolerance budgets: `test/ci/backend_parity.jl`.
- [x] Added runtime smoke checks for CPU and accelerated paths: `test/ci/runtime_smoke.jl`.
- [x] Added deterministic GPU fallback checks and optional hardware smoke jobs: `test/ci/gpu_fallback.jl`, `test/ci/gpu_hardware_smoke.jl`.
- [x] Added non-GPU accelerator strategy checks and CI coverage: `test/ci/coprocessor_strategy.jl`.
- [x] Added certificate integrity CI checks and digest-report artifacts: `test/ci/certificate_integrity.jl`, `.github/workflows/verify-certificates.yml`.
- [x] Added in-tree gRPC unary protobuf binary-wire support (`application/grpc`) with JSON bridge fallback (`application/grpc+json`).
- [x] Added direct `.pt/.pth/.ckpt` import bridge and expanded ONNX export coverage (Dense/Conv/Norm/Pool + activations).
- [x] Added consolidated readiness gate script for local/CI release checks: `scripts/readiness-check.sh`.

### Should
- [ ] Improve performance benchmarking and regression tracking across backends.
- [ ] Expand verification property coverage and diagnostics.
- [ ] Strengthen release automation and compatibility testing.

Should completion gates:
- [ ] Baseline benchmark suite published for CPU Julia, Zig, and GPU extension paths with trend tracking.
- [ ] Verification diagnostics include actionable counterexample metadata and failure categorization.
- [ ] Compatibility matrix is validated across OS/Julia combinations used by supported deployments.
- [ ] Release process produces versioned artifacts and changelog validation automatically.

### Could
- [x] Add richer model packaging and registry workflows (baseline shipped via `model_package_manifest`, `export_model_package`, `build_registry_entry`, `export_registry_entry`, plus CI/evidence coverage).
- [x] Expand advanced optimization passes (fusion, mixed precision) with explicit CI/benchmark evidence coverage (`test/ci/optimization_passes.jl`, `scripts/optimization-evidence.jl`).
- [x] Add deeper observability tooling for runtime verification paths (structured telemetry APIs + CI/evidence coverage).

Could completion gates:
- [x] Packaging format includes model metadata, verification claims, and reproducible hashes (`MODEL_PACKAGE_FORMAT`, `test/ci/model_package_registry.jl`).
- [x] Optional optimization passes are benchmarked and guarded behind explicit flags (`compile(...; optimize, precision)`, `scripts/optimization-evidence.jl`).
- [x] Verification runtime emits structured telemetry suitable for dashboards/incident analysis (`verification_result_telemetry`, `verification_telemetry_report`, `scripts/verification-telemetry-evidence.jl`).

## Deferred Commitments (Tracked)

These roadmap promises are still tracked explicitly (with current delivery state):

- [x] `from_pytorch(...)` import API (baseline shipped: descriptor import + direct `.pt/.pth/.ckpt` bridge + CI interop smoke via `scripts/pytorch_to_axiom_descriptor.py`).
- [x] `to_onnx(...)` export API (baseline shipped: Dense/Conv/Norm/Pool + common activations for supported `Sequential`/`Pipeline` models).
- [x] Production-hardened GPU paths across CUDA/ROCm/Metal (baseline shipped: deterministic fallback CI + optional hardware smoke + extension-hook dispatch + device-range guards + runtime self-healing diagnostics + backend-specific performance evidence via `test/ci/gpu_resilience.jl` and `scripts/gpu-performance-evidence.jl`).
- [ ] Non-GPU accelerators (TPU/NPU/PPU/MATH/FPGA/DSP) backend strategy (in progress: targets, detection, compiled dispatch, fallback/strategy CI, capability/evidence reporting, runtime self-healing diagnostics, resilience CI/evidence, and TPU/NPU/DSP/MATH strict-mode gating shipped via `coprocessor_capability_report`, `coprocessor_runtime_diagnostics`, `scripts/coprocessor-evidence.jl`, `test/ci/coprocessor_resilience.jl`, `scripts/coprocessor-resilience-evidence.jl`, `test/ci/tpu_required_mode.jl`, `scripts/tpu-strict-evidence.jl`, `test/ci/npu_required_mode.jl`, `scripts/npu-strict-evidence.jl`, `test/ci/dsp_required_mode.jl`, `scripts/dsp-strict-evidence.jl`, `test/ci/math_required_mode.jl`, and `scripts/math-strict-evidence.jl`; production kernels remain).
- [ ] Accelerator rollout sequence (2026-02-17): Maths/Physics basics shipped first; cryptographic coprocessor + FPGA production-ready next; VPU + QPU basics after; remaining accelerator production hardening targeted for v2.
- [ ] Proof-assistant export improvements beyond skeleton artifacts (in progress: obligation manifests, bundle export, status metadata, assistant reconciliation, deterministic reconciliation CI, and evidence artifacts shipped via `proof_obligation_manifest`, `export_proof_bundle`, `proof_assistant_obligation_report`, `reconcile_proof_bundle`, `test/ci/proof_bundle_reconciliation.jl`, and `scripts/proof-bundle-evidence.jl`; full assistant proof replay remains a Stage 4 track).

Readiness verification (2026-02-17): `scripts/readiness-check.sh` => Passed: 29, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0.

See `docs/wiki/Roadmap-Commitments.md` for stage mapping and acceptance criteria.

## Definition of Done for "Production Ready"

1. Clean `instantiate/build/precompile/test` on supported Julia versions.
2. Runtime smoke tests for documented examples pass.
3. No unresolved work-marker markers in `src`, `ext`, and `test`.
4. Public docs match implemented APIs and backend support status.
