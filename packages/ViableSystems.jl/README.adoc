== Overview

ViableSystems.jl is a Julia toolkit for modeling and analyzing complex human and organizational systems. It provides formal structures for **Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM)** and **Peter Checkland's Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)**.

== Core Capabilities

* **Viable System Model (VSM)**: Model the 5 recursive systems of viability (Operations, Coordination, Control, Intelligence, Policy).
* **Algedonic Loops**: Implement alarm signals that bypass hierarchies for rapid self-healing.
* **Law of Requisite Variety**: Tools to calculate and balance complexity between environment and system.
* **Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)**: Structured tools for ill-structured problems, including CATWOE analysis and Root Definitions.

== Usage

[source,julia]
----
using ViableSystems

# Define a simple viable organization
org = ViableOrganization(
    "Research Lab",
    [System1(:Physics, "High energy experiments", true)],
    "Shared Calendar",
    "Lab Safety Manager",
    "Strategic Planning Committee",
    "Board of Directors",
    1
)

# Trigger an emergency alert
algedonic_alert(org, "Equipment failure in System 1!")

# Perform a CATWOE analysis
analysis = CATWOE(
    "Researchers", "Coders", "Input -> Verified Code",
    "Open Science", "Hyperpolymath", "Cloud Infrastructure"
)
println(RootDefinition(analysis))
