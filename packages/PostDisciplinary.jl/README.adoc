*Synthesizing Knowledge Across Intellectual Boundaries*

_A framework for unified research workflows that transcend traditional academic disciplines._

toc::[]

== Overview

PostDisciplinary.jl is a meta-framework designed to support research that doesn't fit into a single "department." It provides the glue logic to connect formal logic, historical dynamics, social theory, and computer science into a single, cohesive research artifact. It is the "orchestrator" for the Hyperpolymath ecosystem.

== The Post-Disciplinary Philosophy

Modern problems—AI safety, climate collapse, societal breakdown—are "wicked problems" that cannot be solved by a single discipline. PostDisciplinary.jl moves from:
* **Interdisciplinary**: Talking between departments.
* **Transdisciplinary**: Crossing boundaries.
* **Post-Disciplinary**: Ignoring boundaries entirely to follow the logic of the problem itself.

== Core Capabilities

* **Integrated Research Graphs**: Link evidence from `InvestigativeJournalist.jl` with models from `Cliodynamics.jl`.
* **Cross-Theory Verification**: Verify a social value from `Axiology.jl` using a formal proof in `Axiom.jl`.
* **Universal Ontology**: A common data schema for linking "Entities" (People, Events, Proofs, Claims) across all Hyperpolymath libraries.
* **Orchestration Layer**: Execute complex, multi-library workflows (e.g., "Analyze historical instability, then find causal factors, then verify safety bounds").

== Quick Start

[source,julia]
----
using PostDisciplinary
using Cliodynamics, Causals, Axiom

# Define a post-disciplinary project
project = ResearchProject("Global Instability Analysis")

# Glue logic between libraries
@link project begin
    historical_data = Cliodynamics.load_seshat_data(...)
    causal_model = Causals.CausalGraph(historical_data)
    safety_prop = Axiom.verify(causal_model, ...)
end

# Generate a unified synthesis report
report = generate_synthesis(project)
----

== Suggested Tech Stack

* **Knowledge Graphs**: `Graphs.jl`, `MetaGraphsNext.jl`
* **Synthesis**: `DataFrames.jl`, `JSON3.jl`
* **Reporting**: `Documenter.jl`, `Quarto` (integration)
* **Automation**: `Dagger.jl` for multi-library task orchestration.
