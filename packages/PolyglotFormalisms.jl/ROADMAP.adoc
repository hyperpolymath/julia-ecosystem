= Roadmap
:revdate: 2026-02-17

== Release Baseline (Must)
- Package installs from a clean Julia environment (`Pkg.add`).
- Precompile, build, test, and module load smoke are gated in CI.
- Versioning stays semver and aligned with release refs/tags.

== V2 Backlog (Should)
- Expand CI matrix (OS + Julia versions + optional dependency modes).
- Add performance baselines and regression checks.
- Improve machine-readable evidence and release artifact metadata.

== V2 Backlog (Could)
- Add deeper formal verification evidence exports.
- Add optional accelerator/hardware strategy tracks where relevant.
- Add richer diagnostics and fault-recovery instrumentation.

== Future Horizons (v2.0+)

=== Automated Semantic Equivalence
* [ ] **Cross-Language Proof Runner**: A unified dashboard that visualizes proof status across all `aggregate-library` implementations (Julia, ReScript, Elixir, etc.).
* [ ] **Implementation Synthesis**: Automatically generate "correct-by-construction" code in multiple languages from a single PolyglotFormalisms specification.

=== Hardware-Level Formalisms
* [ ] **Instruction Set Alignment**: Formally verify that `Arithmetic` operations are correctly lowered to specific hardware (e.g., RISC-V) without introducing overflow or precision errors.
* [ ] **Formal Memory Models**: Define and prove cross-language memory consistency models for concurrent operations.

=== Recursive Formalism
* [ ] **Verified Compiler Gates**: Use PolyglotFormalisms to verify the translation logic between different language IRs (Intermediate Representations).
* [ ] **Self-Verifying Registry**: A package registry where every implementation must provide a PolyglotFormalisms proof of compliance before acceptance.

=== AI & Reasoning Formalisms
* [ ] **Neural Property Formalism**: Standardized, formally verified properties for describing neural network behavior (e.g., "Non-increasing monotonicity").
* [ ] **Axiomatic Agent Logic**: Formal definitions for agent intent, value alignment, and safety boundaries (linking to `Axiology.jl`).
