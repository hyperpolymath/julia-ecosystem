= PostDisciplinary.jl Roadmap

== v0.1.0 - The Glue (Current)
* [x] Core data models for `ResearchProject` and `SynthesisReport`.
* [x] Basic "Link" macro for connecting library outputs.
* [x] Common entity schema (mapping entities across `.jl` repos).
* [x] Markdown export for integrated research.

== v0.2.0 - Integrated Workflows
* [ ] Multi-library task orchestration (via Dagger.jl).
* [ ] Cross-package "Search" engine (search claims, proofs, and models simultaneously).
* [ ] Unified visualization dashboard (bringing together Makie plots from different sources).
* [ ] Hypothesis tracker (linking "Post-Disciplinary Hypotheses" to evidence and proofs).

== v0.3.0 - Theory Synthesis
* [x] **Raft Consensus**: Distributed agreement logic for multi-node research networks.
* [x] **Meta-Analysis**: Formal aggregation of Effect Sizes from multiple studies.
* [x] **Knowledge Diffing**: Tools to compare two research graphs and find the "Delta of Truth."
* [x] **Memetics Module**: Formal logic for tracking information replicators and mutation paths.
* [x] **Methodology Engine**: Native support for Multi, Inter, Trans, and Anti-disciplinary research modes (NLC Journal alignment).
* [x] **Expert Synthesis**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing and Graph of Thought (GoT) logic.
* [x] **Computational Hermeneutics**: Formal implementation of the Hermeneutic Circle for iterative interpretation.
* [x] **Mixed-Methods Orchestrator**: Logic for Quant, Qual, and Mixed research designs.
* [x] **Impact & Utilisation Tracker**: Tools to measure knowledge transfer and strategic influence.
* [x] **Research Templates**: Pre-configured skeletons for Wicked Problems, Structural Forensics, and Action Research.
* [ ] "Bridge Theories": Formal logic for mapping terms between disciplines.
* [ ] Automated "Literature Synthesis" from `InvestigativeJournalist.jl` records.
* [ ] Conflict resolution between disciplinary models.

== v1.0.0 - Universal Research OS
* [ ] Full Quarto/Jupyter integration for publishing "Executable Synthesis".
* [ ] Community "Ontology Registry" for shared research terms.
* [ ] Cloud-native research backend for large-scale team collaboration.

== Future Horizons (v2.0+)

=== Computational Wisdom
* [ ] **Epistemic Invariant Proofs**: Use `Axiom.jl` to prove that a specific synthesis report doesn't violate core axioms from any of its constituent disciplines.
* [ ] **Synthetic Scholar**: An AI agent that "Reads" the output of all other `.jl` libraries and suggests "Post-Disciplinary" links that a human might have missed.

=== Planetary Scale Synthesis
* [ ] **Automated Peer Review**: Use `Axiom.jl` and `MetaAnalysis` to automatically review and score new papers against the global knowledge graph.
* [ ] **Consensus Computer**: A global, decentralized network of `RaftNode` instances that maintains the canonical "State of Science."
* [ ] **Global Research Gossip Protocol**: Enable decentralized synthesis of knowledge across hundreds of research nodes (linking to `Skein.jl` federated search).
* [ ] **Axiomatic World Modeling**: Formal, proven models of global systemic risk that integrate history, economics, ethics, and physics.

=== Cognitive Extensions
* [ ] **Neural Knowledge Synthesis**: Use Large Language Models to "summarize" the high-level implications of low-level formal proofs for policy-makers.
* [ ] **Immersive Synthesis**: VR environments for "walking through" the knowledge graph of a post-disciplinary problem.
