*Native Julia Client for the Lithoglyph Symbolic Database.*

Lithoglyph.jl provides a high-integrity bridge to the Lithoglyph ecosystem. It allows Julia researchers to store, normalize, and query symbolic data (glyphs) across federated nodes.

== Core Capabilities

* **Symbolic Storage**: Register discrete glyphs with rich metadata and provenance.
* **FFI Bridge**: Native calls to the core Zig/Forth normalization engine.
* **Federated Search**: Query multiple Lithoglyph nodes from a single Julia client.
* **Axiomatic Provenance**: Link symbols to their "unbreakable" Idris2 specifications.

== Usage

[source,julia]
----
using Lithoglyph

client = LithoglyphClient("https://litho.local", "secret-token")

# Create a new symbol
g = Glyph(:MySymbol, "data...", ["tag1"], "hash...")

# Register it
register_glyph(client, g)
