*Bringing Julia Logic to the World's Most Reliable Microkernel.*

== Overview

MinixSDK.jl is a research-grade toolkit for developing and deploying high-assurance services for the **MINIX 3 microkernel** using Julia. It provides cross-compilation bridges and IPC (Inter-Process Communication) wrappers to allow Julia-based research to run as native MINIX services.

== Why MINIX?

MINIX 3 is designed for high reliability and self-healing (reincarnation). By bridging Julia to MINIX, we enable:
1. **Fault-Tolerant Drivers**: Write drivers in Julia that MINIX can automatically restart if they fail.
2. **Verified Micro-Services**: Use the Hyperpolymath ecosystem to verify logic before deploying it to the MINIX core.

== Current Status
**Research Prototype**. Focused on C-code generation and cross-compilation stubs.
