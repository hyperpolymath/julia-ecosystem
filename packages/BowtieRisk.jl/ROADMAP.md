## Future Horizons (v2.0+)

### Immersive & Holographic Risk
- [ ] **Holographic Control Room**: Beyond 3D, integrate with WebXR/Unity for real-time holographic "Risk Dashboards" in industrial control rooms.
- [ ] **Digital Twin Walkthroughs**: AR-guided barrier inspections where the bowtie model is overlaid on physical assets (e.g., seeing "Barrier Effectiveness" on a real valve via AR glasses).

### Human & Cognitive Factor Modeling
- [ ] **Cognitive Barrier Simulation**: Integrate with cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT-R) to model human error probability under high-stress/emergency conditions.
- [ ] **Social Barrier Dynamics**: Model how organizational culture and communication patterns (via `Agents.jl`) act as "soft" preventive barriers.

### Specialized Risk Domains
- [ ] **Bio-Security & Synthetic Risk**: Tailored bowtie templates for high-containment labs, modeling bio-decay and genetic containment as specific barriers.
- [ ] **Cyber-Physical Attack Pathways**: Integrated modeling of cyber-attacks as threats that degrade physical safety barriers (e.g., Stuxnet-style scenarios).

### Automated Liability & Insurance
- [ ] **Liability Attribution Engine**: Mapping barrier failures to legal liability frameworks and insurance policy clauses automatically.
- [ ] **Smart Contract Insurance Bridge**: Use blockchain-based "Axiomatic Oracles" to trigger insurance payouts automatically when a verified barrier failure occurs.

## Migration Path

**v1.0 → v1.1:** Backward compatible (new features, optional parameters)
**v1.1 → v1.2:** Mostly compatible (FTA/ETA integration may require model schema updates)
**v1.2 → v1.3+:** Breaking changes likely (AI features may require new data structures)

## Community Goals

- **5 industry case studies** published by v1.2
- **Integration with major RAMS tools** (CARA, PHA-Pro) by v1.2
- **Presentation at ESREL conference** (European Safety and Reliability) by v1.2
- **Partnership with process safety consultancy** for real-world validation
