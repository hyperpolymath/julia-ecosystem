== Overview

ProvenCrypto.jl provides a Julia library of *formally verified* cryptographic protocols and post-quantum primitives. This project is part of the hyperpolymath ecosystem, emphasizing mathematical proofs of correctness, security, and robustness.

== Features

* **Formal Verification**: All cryptographic primitives are accompanied by machine-checked proofs of security properties.
* **Post-Quantum Security**: Includes algorithms resistant to quantum computing attacks.
* **Julia Integration**: Designed for high performance and seamless integration with the Julia scientific computing ecosystem.
* **Interoperability**: Follows the Hyperpolymath Universal Standard for ABI/FFI, ensuring compatibility with other languages and systems.

== Core Components

=== 1. Cryptographic Primitives

* **Symmetric Encryption**: AES, ChaCha20 (with formal proofs)
* **Asymmetric Encryption**: Kyber, Dilithium (post-quantum)
* **Hash Functions**: SHA-3, BLAKE3 (with collision resistance proofs)
* **Signatures**: Ed25519, SPHINCS+ (post-quantum)

=== 2. Formal Proofs

* **Correctness**: Proofs that implementations match their mathematical specifications.
* **Security**: Proofs of resistance to known attacks (e.g., side-channel, quantum).
* **Interoperability**: Proofs of ABI/FFI compliance for cross-language use.

== Usage

=== Installation

[source,julia]
----
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/hyperpolymath/ProvenCrypto.jl")
----

=== Example: Secure Key Exchange

[source,julia]
----
using ProvenCrypto

# Generate a post-quantum key pair
(sk, pk) = generate_keypair(:kyber)

# Encrypt/decrypt with formal guarantees
ciphertext = encrypt(pk, "secret message")
plaintext = decrypt(sk, ciphertext)
----

== Verification

All proofs are available in the `proofs/` directory and can be checked using:

* Idris2 (for ABI/FFI correctness)
* Lean/Coq (for cryptographic properties)

== Standards Compliance

* **ABI/FFI**: Follows the Hyperpolymath Universal Standard for cross-language compatibility.
* **AI CLI**: Includes crash capture and contractile support for automated verification.

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure all new code includes:
1. Formal proofs of correctness and security.
2. Comprehensive tests.
3. Documentation updates.
