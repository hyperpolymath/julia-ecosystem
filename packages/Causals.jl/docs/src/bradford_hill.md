# Bradford Hill Criteria

The Bradford Hill module provides systematic assessment of causal relationships using the nine Bradford Hill criteria.

## Key Concepts

- **Strength of Association**: How strong is the relationship?
- **Consistency**: Is it replicated across studies?
- **Specificity**: Is the effect specific to the exposure?
- **Temporality**: Does cause precede effect?
- **Biological Gradient**: Is there a dose-response relationship?
- **Plausibility**: Is there a plausible mechanism?
- **Coherence**: Does it fit with existing knowledge?
- **Experiment**: Is there experimental evidence?
- **Analogy**: Are there analogous relationships?
