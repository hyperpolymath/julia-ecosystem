== Future Horizons (v3.0+)

=== AI-Augmented Phylogeny
* [ ] **GNN Topology Prediction**: Integrate with `Axiom.jl` to use Graph Neural Networks for predicting tree topologies from high-dimensional genomic data.
* [ ] **Deep Evolutionary Embedding**: Use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn low-dimensional "Evolutionary Latent Spaces" for species.

=== Multimodal & Non-Genic Cladistics
* [ ] **Epigenetic Tree Construction**: Support for incorporating methylation and other epigenetic markers into the distance and character matrices.
* [ ] **Cultural & Linguistic Cladistics**: Specialized templates for modeling the evolution of languages and cultural traits (linking to `Cliodynamics.jl`).

=== Real-Time & Streaming Evolution
* [ ] **Streaming Cladistics Engine**: Incrementally update large phylogenetic trees as new sequence data arrives (essential for real-time pathogen surveillance).
* [ ] **Dynamic Phylodynamic Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of substitution rates and selection pressure across branches.

=== Axiomatic Evolutionary Invariants
* [ ] **Formal Monophyly Verification**: Link with `Axiom.jl` to formally prove that a proposed tree topology satisfies specific biological constraints or monophyly rules.
* [ ] **Verified Evolutionary Bounds**: Provide mathematically guaranteed bounds on divergence times and ancestral state probabilities.
