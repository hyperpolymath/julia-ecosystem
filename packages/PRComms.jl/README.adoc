*Strategic Public Relations and Communications Operations*

_Consistent messaging, media mastery, and crisis resilience._

toc::[]

== Overview

PRComms.jl is a management framework for communications professionals. It provides structured tools for message architecture, media outreach, campaign coordination, and high-pressure crisis response. By treating communications as a data-driven operation, it ensures consistency across channels and improves the speed and quality of stakeholder responses.

== Core Capabilities

* **Message Architecture**: Define pillars, proof points, and audience-specific variants to ensure coherent brand voice.
* **Newsroom Workflow**: Manage the draft, review, and embargo lifecycle of press releases.
* **Media Contact Management**: Track journalist interaction history, beats, and outlets.
* **Campaign Coordination**: Integrated calendar and asset tracking for multi-channel launches.
* **Crisis Mode Playbooks**: Pre-defined escalation trees and holding statements for rapid response.

== Quick Start

[source,julia]
----
using PRComms

# Define a message pillar
pillar = create_message_pillar("Sustainability", ["Carbon neutral by 2030", "Verified supply chain"])

# Generate a variant for social media
variant = generate_audience_variant(pillar, audience=:retail, channel=:twitter)

# Draft a press release
release = draft_press_release(campaign_id, "Key facts about the launch...")

# Activate crisis workflow
if incident_detected
    activate_crisis_mode(:data_breach)
end
----

== Suggested Tech Stack

* **Data**: `DataFrames.jl`, `JSON3.jl`
* **Templating**: `Mustache.jl` for press release generation.
* **Dashboards**: `Makie.jl` or `VegaLite.jl` for sentiment and outreach visualization.
* **Integrations**: `HTTP.jl` for news intake.

== Governance

* **Approval Gates**: Every external message requires explicit sign-off logs.
* **Risk Gating**: Built-in "Red-Flag" checks for legal and regulatory sensitivity.
* **Immutable Logs**: Audit trail for all publication and outreach actions.
