== Overview

This is the central monorepo for the **Hyperpolymath Julia Ecosystem**. It consolidates 20+ specialized libraries into a single, cohesive research and development environment. From formal logic and cryptography to historical dynamics and labor organizing, this ecosystem provides the "Post-Disciplinary Glue" to tackle complex global challenges.
