*Empowering Labor with Data-Driven Organizing*

_Strategic intelligence for unions: from membership mapping to collective bargaining._

toc::[]

== Overview

TradeUnionist.jl is a management and analysis toolkit for labor unions and organizing committees. It provides high-integrity structures for mapping workplaces, tracking member engagement, managing the grievance lifecycle, and supporting collective bargaining with transparent costing and clause comparison.

== Core Capabilities

* **Workplace Mapping**: Detailed visualization of sites, departments, and shifts to identify organizing gaps.
* **Member Engagement**: Track the "Organizer Conversation" lifecycle and sentiment across the workforce.
* **Grievance Pipeline**: Integrated intake, evidence logging, and deadline management for contract enforcement.
* **Bargaining Support**: Side-by-side contract clause comparison and fiscal costing of proposals.
* **Mobilization Planning**: Data-driven action planning for strike votes, rallies, and turnouts.

== Quick Start

[source,julia]
----
using TradeUnionist

# Register a new worksite
site = register_worksite(employer="GlobalCorp", headcount=500)

# Log an organizing conversation
log_conversation(member_id, "Highly supportive of higher wages", sentiment=0.8)

# Open a grievance case
case = open_grievance(member_id, "Unsafe machinery in Dept B")

# Cost a bargaining proposal
proposal = build_proposal(clause_id, "10% wage increase")
println("Total unit cost: ", cost_estimate(proposal))
----

== Suggested Tech Stack

* **Data**: `DataFrames.jl`, `Arrow.jl`, `JSON3.jl`
* **Analysis**: `Statistics`, `StatsBase.jl`
* **Visualization**: `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` for engagement heatmaps.
* **Persistence**: `SQLite.jl` or `DuckDB.jl`

== Governance & Risk

* **Permissioned Access**: Rigid security model for sensitive member data.
* **Privacy-First**: Support for redaction and retention policies to protect workers from employer retaliation.
* **Auditable Bargaining**: Immutable logs for all contract revisions and proposal costing.
