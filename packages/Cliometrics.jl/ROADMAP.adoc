=== Domain Expansion
* Demographic historical analysis
* Historical price indices and inflation
* Agricultural productivity over time
* Technological change measurement

== Future Horizons (v2.0+)

=== Quantum & Non-Linear Cliometrics
* [ ] **Quantum Economic Modeling**: Integrate with `Axiom.jl` to use quantum-inspired probability for analyzing periods of extreme economic uncertainty or phase transitions (e.g., historical market crashes).
* [ ] **Complex Economic Bifurcations**: Formalize the mathematical "Tipping Points" in historical trade networks that lead to Great Divergences or Convergence.

=== Automated Counterfactual Search
* [ ] **Optimal Policy Search**: Use optimization algorithms (via `JuMP.jl`) to find the "minimal historical change" needed to reach a different economic outcome (e.g., preventing the Great Depression).
* [ ] **Causal Policy Attribution**: Link with `Causals.jl` to formally attribute economic growth to specific historical policy interventions versus exogenous shocks.

=== Cross-Species & Biological Cliometrics
* [ ] **Biocliometrics**: Apply economic growth accounting and resource allocation models to the "history" of different species and ecosystems over geological time.
* [ ] **Energy Flow History**: Map the "Thermodynamic History" of civilizations as a series of energy extraction and dissipation efficiency gains.

=== Axiomatic Economic Invariants
* [ ] **Verified Economic Models**: Link with `Axiom.jl` to formally prove that a historical economic model satisfies specific "Conservation of Value" or "Fairness" properties (e.g., verifying that a trade model is non-exploitative).
* [ ] **Axiomatic Inequality Limits**: Formally prove the theoretical upper/lower bounds of inequality in various historical economic structures (e.g., slave economies vs. industrial ones).

== Community Goals

* Academic citations in economic history research
* Collaboration with Cliometric Society
* JuliaCon presentation
* Publication in _Economic History Review_ or _Explorations in Economic History_
