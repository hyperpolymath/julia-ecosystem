= SMTLib.jl Roadmap

== Current Position
SMTLib.jl is functionally usable and tested, but still needs release/governance hardening to match the operational posture used by Axiom.jl.

== Must (Current Stage)
- Keep package metadata and machine-readable state aligned for each release.
- Maintain changelog, roadmap, and release-readiness docs as release gates.
- Enforce CODEOWNERS + workflow security linting + pinned actions in CI.
- Keep `scripts/readiness-check.sh` passing in CI (strict mode).
- Keep install/load/test baseline healthy for JuliaHub-facing refs.

== Intend (Next Stage)
- Add solver-backed integration jobs by solver kind (z3/cvc5/yices/mathsat).
- Add deterministic evidence artifacts for capability and test summary claims.
- Add branch-protection alignment checklist to repo docs.
- Publish SMTLib.jl through the chosen registry path and document consumer migration.

== Like (Later)
- Add benchmark baselines and regression thresholds.
- Add solver compatibility matrix by version and operating system.
- Add richer failure diagnostics and strict-mode profiles for production environments.

== Future Horizons (v2.0+)

=== Browser & Edge Verification
* [ ] **WASM Solver Integration**: Support for running SMT solvers (Z3/CVC5) directly in Julia WASM environments or browsers for zero-install client-side verification.
* [ ] **Embedded SMT**: Lightweight, verified SMT-LIB emission for resource-constrained IoT devices.

=== Program Synthesis
* [ ] **CEGIS Engine**: Implement a Counter-Example Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) framework for automatically generating Julia code from SMT specifications.
* [ ] **Verified Rewrite Rules**: Tools to synthesize and formally prove the correctness of compiler optimization passes using SMTLib.jl.

=== Scalability & Performance
* [ ] **Distributed SMT Partitioning**: Integration with `Dagger.jl` to split large proof obligations across a cluster, using parallel solver instances.
* [ ] **Portfolio Solving**: Automatically run multiple solvers (Z3, CVC5, Yices) in parallel and return the first result, improving robustness for hard problems.

=== Explainability & Proofs
* [ ] **Human-Readable Proof Explainer**: Translate Unsat Cores and SMT models into high-level natural language justifications for why a verification failed.
* [ ] **Proof-Assistant Export**: Generate Coq/Isabelle/Lean proof scripts directly from solver-produced proof certificates.

== Scope Note
SMTLib.jl focuses on solver interoperability and verification plumbing.

The following are tracked as broader Axiom platform tracks, not SMTLib immediate blockers:
- Physics coprocessor production hardening
- VPU production hardening
- FPGA production hardening
- QPU baseline/production progression
