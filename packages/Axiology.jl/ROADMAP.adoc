== Future Horizons (v4.0+)

=== Dynamic Value Evolution
* [ ] **Value Drift Detection**: Monitor and alert when system behavior diverges from historical value alignments due to distributional shift.
* [ ] **Recursive Value Refinement**: Implement active learning loops where the system proactively seeks human feedback on "edge case" ethical dilemmas.
* [ ] **Temporal Value Consistency**: Formally verify that value-aligned decisions today do not preclude value alignment in the far future (long-termism).

=== Pluralistic & Cross-Cultural Axiology
* [ ] **Ethical Profile Mapping**: Support for switchable value profiles (e.g., Virtue Ethics, Ubuntu, Confucianism) and conflict resolution between them.
* [ ] **Relativist Verification**: Tools to verify a system against multiple, potentially contradictory, value frameworks simultaneously.

=== Axiomatic Hardware & Low-Level Safety
* [ ] **Axiomatic HDL**: Extend value verification to hardware descriptions (Verilog/VHDL/Chisel) to ensure safety invariants are baked into the silicon.
* [ ] **Value-Gated Execution**: Runtime monitoring at the OS/Kernel level that can halt execution if a "Value Invariant" is violated.

=== Synthetic Axiology
* [ ] **Axiologically-Guided Data Generation**: Use value constraints to guide GANs or LLMs to generate training data that is "Fair/Safe by Design".
* [ ] **Moral Sandbox Simulations**: High-fidelity environments for "stress-testing" AI agents against complex, multi-agent ethical scenarios.
