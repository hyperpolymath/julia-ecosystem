= Roadmap
:revdate: 2026-02-17

== Release Baseline (Must)
- Package installs from a clean Julia environment (`Pkg.add`).
- Precompile, build, test, and module load smoke are gated in CI.
- Versioning stays semver and aligned with release refs/tags.

== V2 Backlog (Should)
- Expand CI matrix (OS + Julia versions + optional dependency modes).
- Add performance baselines and regression checks.
- Improve machine-readable evidence and release artifact metadata.

== V2 Backlog (Could)
- Add deeper formal verification evidence exports.
- Add optional accelerator/hardware strategy tracks where relevant.
- Add richer diagnostics and fault-recovery instrumentation.

== Future Horizons (v2.0+)

=== Axiomatic Side-Channel Mitigation
* [ ] **Constant-Time Verification**: Link with `Axiom.jl` to formally prove that critical primitive implementations (NTT, SHA3, AES) have data-independent execution time to prevent side-channel leaks.
* [ ] **Verified Memory Sanitization**: Proofs that sensitive key material is effectively zeroed out from memory across all supported Julia garbage collection modes.

=== Topological & Physical Cryptography
* [ ] **Knot-Theoretic PKI**: Integration with `KnotTheory.jl` to prototype cryptographic schemes where security is based on the hardness of the "Markov Problem" for braids and knots.
* [ ] **Quantum-Key-Distribution (QKD) Simulator**: Verified models for BB84 and other QKD protocols, integrating with existing post-quantum primitives.

=== Advanced Cryptographic Computing
* [ ] **Verified Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: Implement a formally verified version of the TFHE or CKKS scheme for performing privacy-preserving computation on encrypted data.
* [ ] **Privacy-Preserving Proofs for MPC**: Formalize and prove the privacy properties of Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and Threshold Signatures.

=== Secure Enclave & Hardware Hardening
* [ ] **Enclave-Aware Compilation**: Tools to verify the partitioning of code between "Untrusted" host memory and "Secure" enclave memory (SGX/TrustZone).
* [ ] **FPGA-Verified Kernels**: Hardened HDL kernels for PQC primitives, formally verified against the Idris2 specification (linking to `Axiology.jl` hardware goals).
