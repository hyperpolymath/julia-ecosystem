A Julia framework for modeling **exnovation decisions**—phasing out legacy practices to enable innovation.

toc::[]

== What is Exnovation.jl?

Exnovation.jl is a **decision modeling framework** designed to help organizations and researchers systematically analyze, plan, and execute the phase-out of outdated technologies, processes, or practices. It provides tools to:

- **Model legacy systems** and their dependencies
- **Simulate phase-out scenarios** and their impacts
- **Optimize transition paths** to minimize disruption
- **Validate exnovation strategies** with formal guarantees

=== Example: Modeling a Legacy Phase-Out

[source,julia]
----
using Exnovation

@exnovate LegacySystem begin
    legacy_process :: Process(legacy=true, cost=1000, risk=0.8)
    new_process :: Process(legacy=false, cost=500, risk=0.2)

    transition = legacy_process --> new_process
    @ensure transition.cost < 1500
    @ensure transition.risk < 0.5
end

strategy = LegacySystem()
result = simulate(strategy, horizon=5)
----

== Features

=== Scenario Simulation
Simulate the impact of phasing out legacy systems over time, with support for:
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Risk assessment
- Resource allocation

[source,julia]
----
@exnovate EnergyTransition begin
    coal :: EnergySource(legacy=true, emissions=1000)
    solar :: EnergySource(legacy=false, emissions=0)

    transition = coal --> solar
    @ensure transition.emissions_reduction > 90%
end
----

=== Dependency Mapping
Visualize and analyze dependencies between legacy and new systems to identify critical path dependencies and bottlenecks.

[source,julia]
----
dependencies = map_dependencies(legacy_system, new_system)
plot(dependencies)
----

=== Formal Validation
Ensure that exnovation strategies meet organizational constraints and regulatory requirements.

[source,julia]
----
@exnovate ComplianceCheck begin
    old_policy :: Policy(legacy=true, compliance_risk=0.9)
    new_policy :: Policy(legacy=false, compliance_risk=0.1)

    transition = old_policy --> new_policy
    @prove transition.compliance_risk < 0.2
end
----

=== Integration with Julia Ecosystem
Leverage Julia’s data science and optimization tools for advanced analysis.

[source,julia]
----
using DataFrames, Plots

results = simulate(exnovation_strategy, iterations=1000)
df = DataFrame(results)
plot(df, x=:time, y=:cost, group=:scenario)
----

== Quick Start

=== Installation
[source,julia]
----
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Exnovation")
----

=== Hello World
[source,julia]
----
using Exnovation

@exnovate SimpleTransition begin
    old :: System(legacy=true, cost=100)
    new :: System(legacy=false, cost=50)

    transition = old --> new
    @ensure transition.cost < 120
end

strategy = SimpleTransition()
result = simulate(strategy)
----

== Why Exnovation.jl?

=== The Problem
Organizations often struggle to retire legacy systems due to:
- Complex dependencies
- Uncertain costs and risks
- Resistance to change

=== The Solution
Exnovation.jl provides a **structured, data-driven approach** to exnovation, enabling:
- Evidence-based decision-making
- Transparent impact analysis
- Formal validation of transition plans
